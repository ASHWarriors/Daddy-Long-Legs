## Here is a technical overview of the project. ##
- Used web-parsing to fetch relevant data required for estimation of the living/education and other daily expenses of children belonging to different age groups
- Used MySQL Relational Database Management System to maintain records of students, surplus funds and Godparents.
- Used basic Django, HTML/CSS stack to implement the above into a basic web-app.
- Connected GodChildren with preference to lower age groups. Gave the choice to the Godparent to choose the area where he wished to contribute and set his budget.
- Maintained a waitlist for Godparents to connect them with Godchildren on no availabilty of Godchildren.

## Pending Issues: ##

- Unique ID Generation : The id code needs testing and debugging.
- Django codes need systematic cleanup.
-WaitList : Some features need to be implemented. Codes under progress.
