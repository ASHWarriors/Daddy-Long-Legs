# Daddy-Long-Legs
Our first project using Django-MySQL-HTML/CSS Stack.


This project was designed to connect willing Godparents to Godchildren and help them academically and monetarily.
Further details regarding the aim, overview and future scope of development would be available in the attached presentation.

Here is a technical overview of the project.
-> Used web-parsing to fetch relevant data required for estimation of the living/education and other daily expenses of children belonging to different age groups
-> Used MySQL Relational Database Management System to maintain records of students, surplus funds and Godparents.
-> Used basic Django, HTML/CSS stack to implement the above into a basic web-app.
-> Connected GodChildren with preference to lower age groups. Gave the choice to the Godparent to choose the area where he wished to contribute and set his budget.
-> Maintained a waitlist for Godparents to connect them with Godchildren on no availabilty of Godchildren.


Pending Issues:
Unique ID Generation-- the id code needs testing and debugging.
Django codes need systematic cleanup.
WaitList-- some features need to be implemented. Codes under progress.
